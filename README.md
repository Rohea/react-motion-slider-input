# React-Motion-Slider-Input

A React library/plugin for creating highly customizable input sliders. Uses React-Motion for nice animations.

This library is currently under heavy development. You can check it out if you really want but I highly discourage using it in anywhere yet. Watch this space for updates in the near future. A tagged version will be available as soon as this is at least somewhat usable.

### Install

Currently:

Checkout the repository and transpile e.g. with Babel (React and ES2015 plugins turned on)

In the future: (NOT WORKING YET)

- Npm: `npm install --save react`
- Npm: `npm install --save react-motion`
- Npm: `npm install --save react-motion-slider-input`

### Dependencies

- React.js (peer dependency)
- React-Motion (peer dependency)
- Immutable.js

### Why, oh why?

Because world desperately needs yet another slider plugin, don't you think. There simply aren't enough of them.
