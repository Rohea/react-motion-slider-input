# React-Motion-Slider-Input

A React library/plugin for creating highly customizable input sliders. Uses React-Motion for nice animations.

This library is currently under heavy development. You can check it out if you really want but I highly discourage using it in anywhere yet. Watch this space for updates in the near future. A tagged version will be available as soon as this is at least somewhat usable.

### Install

Make sure React and React-Motion are installed

- `npm install --save react`
- `npm install --save react-motion`

Install this library

- `npm install --save react-motion-slider-input`

Link css to your project from `lib/SliderInput.css` and create your own styles.

### Dependencies

- React.js (peer dependency)
- React-Motion (peer dependency)
- Immutable.js

### Usage

```
import { SliderInput } from 'react-motion-slider-input';

... other code ...

render() {
  return (
    <SliderInput />
  );
}
```

### Configuration


### Why, oh why?

Because world desperately needs yet another slider plugin, don't you think. There simply aren't enough of them.
